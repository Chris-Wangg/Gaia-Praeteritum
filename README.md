# Gaia-Praeteritum
- A lore poem from a videogame.

_Will of iron,_

_Born of mettle,_

_Steel yourselves,_

_Against their metal._

_Body of fire,_

_Eyes of green,_

_From fire's breath,_

_To scales of stone._

_Dear Childe of Gaia,_

_Dare not weep._

_Truth are giv'd to those,_

_Who are meek._

_Raze the lands,_

_For all is seen._

_Cull all those who DESECRATE our lands,_

_Beneath the Sun._
